# Introduction
## Code Institute Project 2 - HTML, SCSS & JS
MEMEIT is a simple tool that allows users to create their own meme and download the file to their device. The application automatically resizes positions the uploaded image to the center of the canvas and ensures that the width/height is always filled according to the size of 1024px. The application also generates a watermark which cannot be removed.
